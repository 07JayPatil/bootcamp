 Charity Donation Tracker

 ðŸ“Œ Description
The **Charity Donation Tracker** is a simple Move smart contract built for the Aptos blockchain.  
It allows users to create a charity and track total donations in AptosCoin.  
The contract contains only two main functions:
1. `create_charity` â†’ Initialize a charity with a name.
2. `donate` â†’ Allow any user to send AptosCoins to the charity while updating the donation record.

 ðŸŽ¯ Vision
Our vision is to create a **transparent and trustless** platform for charitable contributions,  
where donors can see exactly how much has been donated to a cause without relying on intermediaries.

 ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Donation History Tracking â€“ Implement events to store and view every donation.
- Multiple Charities Support â€“ Allow a single account to manage several charities.
- Token Support â€“ Accept other tokens in addition to AptosCoin.
- Public Dashboard â€“ Build a web interface to display donation stats in real-time.
- Automated Fund Distribution â€“ Enable smart rules for automatic payouts to beneficiaries.
